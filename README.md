This docker image provides a image that allows users to run Ansible no matter what the host platform OS is.

## Ansible via Docker Tool

Provides a wrapper around the ansible image that allows the execution of Ansible and it's related
tools via Docker containers instead of relying on the underlying operating system to support and
run Ansible natively. This allows Ansible to run as a control node on a Windows-based OS with some
limitations.

By utilizing Ansible's playbooks, roles, and modules, developers can automate the deployment of
software applications across multiple hosting providers, reducing the time and effort required to
manage complex infrastructure environments. These playbooks, roles, and modules enable developers to
create, manage, and provision infrastructure resources like virtual machines, load balancers, and
databases.
